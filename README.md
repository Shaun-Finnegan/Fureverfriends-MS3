## Wireframes
The wireframes below Where created at the beginnig of this project with a mobile first approach in mind. The aim was to keep the design as simple as possible so as not to take away from the experience that the game itself would provide. These wire frames where created with a software called [Just In Mind](https://www.justinmind.com/)

## Color Scheme
For this project bright and vibrant colors where used. The reason for this was to help put the user in a positive state of mind whilst using the site, which would allow them to develop a positive association to the site and the charity name.


## Structure
The structure of the website was kept as simple as possible. This would allow the user to easily navigate through the site and find the information that they are looking for.
The main focus of this site is to allow users to view and find information on the animals we are looking to rehome and then book a viewing to meet the animal that they are interested in.
So it was felt that the site should be kept as simple as possible to not distract from the main focus of the site.


## Features

### Navigation Bar and Logo
This allows the user to quickly and easily navigate through the site to find the information that they are looking for. The Logo also acts as a link and will return the user to the home page.

### Banner image
This is found under the navigation bar on each page of the website. Each banner image contains a picture of a different animal. This is done to encourage an emotive response from the user.

## Technologies Used

* CSS
* Python
* Flask
* Github
* Heroku
* SQLAlchemy
* PostgreSQL
* Jinja
* ElephantSQL


### Additional Tools Used For This Project

* Justinmind prototyping tool
* Chrome Developer Tools


## Testing

### Cross Platform Testing

Once the site was completed and deployed it was tested on four web browsers to check that the application behaved and performed the same way on each one. The browsers used where:

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla FireFox
* Microsoft Edge
* Safari

Overall I was pleased to see that the sites performancer and behaviour was consistent througfhout all four browsers.


### Compatability Testing

Once deployed the site was tested on numerous devices to ensure that performance and behaviour were consistent. The devices used are as follows:

* Asus VivoBook
* Ipad Air 3
* Samsung Galaxy s8
* OPPO A72
* Various templates within Chrome Dev Tools

Performance and behaviour of the application whilst being tested on these devices was consistent and the application behaved as intended on each device.


### Responsive Testing

As well as the application been tested on all the devices mentioned above, the application was also tested using the responsive screen view in chrome dev tools. This additional testing really helped to pick out any responsiveness issues that had previously been overlooked. However the application was very responsive and behaved the way the developer intended on all screen sizes.



## Validator Testing

### HTML
The tool I chose to use to validate my HTML was [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and I am delighted to say that there were no errors or major issues with my Markup. As you can see from below.

#### Home Page

![Home Page](fureverfriends/static/readme-images/home-html-validator.png)


#### About Page

![About Page](fureverfriends/static/readme-images/about-html-validator.png)


#### Rehoming Page

#### Meet Our Animals Page

![Meet Our Animals](fureverfriends/static/readme-images/meet-html-validator.png)



### Semantic HTML
As you can see from the above images there are a few warnings been shown by the validator.

I could resolve these warnings by replacing the semantic HTML with DIV tags. However I have decided that due to the website having a specific structure  It was important to leave the sementic elements within my markup.

This has had no effect on the perfomance or accessibility of the website.


### CSS

The validation service used for testing my CSS was the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and I was delighted to see that there where no major issues or errors with my CSS file.


![CSS Validator](fureverfriends/static/readme-images/css-validator.png)


### Python
The service is used to validate the Python code for this project was The Code Institute's [Python Validation Service](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).
I was delighted to see that apart from a few indentation errors there were no major issues with my code.

## Performance and Accessibility Testing

To test the overall performance and accessibility of the application U used The Google Chrome Lighthouse Extension I tested both performance and accesibility on desktop and mobile devices and I was very pleased with the results.
